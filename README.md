# Floor-Level-Net
- Code for paper "FloorLevel-Net: Recognizing Floor-Level Lines With Height-Attention-Guided Multi-Task Learning."
(which is mainly based on the code of "Cars Canâ€™t Fly up in the Sky: Improving Urban-Scene Segmentation via Height-driven Attention Networks" many thanks to the authors).
- Pretrained model and example datasets under our augmentation scheme can be downloaded with link.
- Dataset for floor recognition of facades and augmented code are pending release.
